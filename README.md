# BloX
A Tetris game clone for SunOS 4.x and written in XView.

I wrote this Tetris inspired game in late 1991 and published it internally at Sun Microsystems in 1992.  It was available for employees to play on a public binaries directlory.

It was written with XView libraries which was Sun's way of writing OpenLook applications.

If any old Sun aficionados are able to compile and run it on a early 90's Sun hardware or emulation, I'd be happy to include screen shots of it running here on this page.
